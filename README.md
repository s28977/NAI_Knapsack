Instructions
Write implementation of brute-force solution for knapsack problem. Your program should generate all
possible characteristic vectors representing potential solutions but print only the final one.

You have to implement the method for generating characteristic vectors from scratch. You cannot use predefined methods for that like Set,
characteristicVector, toBinaryString or other.

As a result print characteristic vector, total weight and total value of the best solution.
Your program should find the solution in a few minutes. Implementations that execution time exceed 20 minutes won't be accepted.

Hint: Execution time depends on the programming language you choose.
Optional: Print execution time

Format of each file provided in attachment:
first line: total capacity
each next line: weight, value of item
